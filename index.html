                        <h2>Eval is evil</h2>
                        <p>Eval passes a string to the javascript compiler and executes the result.</p>
                        <p>Eval is consistantly misused, usually by dummies and ignoramuses.</p>

                        <h2>For example</h2>
                        <p>Little Billy wants to add a new property to his object.  He wants his app to ascertain the user's dad's favorite food, and create a new property with that food.</p>
                        <p>Billy is familiar enough with dot notation to know that if he tries to create a new property with the variable, it will create a property with the variable name instead of it's value.  Billy is not familiar with the subscript operator a.k.a. bracket notation.  Billy decides to use eval instead of google.</p>
                        <pre>
    var myObj = {};
    var thisKey = document.getElementById('dadsFaveFood').value;
    eval('dynamicProp = myObj.' + thisKey + ';');
                        </pre>
                        <p>The correct way to dynamically create properties is with the subscript operator.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Not only is the eval option a disgusting sight to behold, it's significantly slower because it has to run the compiler to execute.  It's also a big security risk, what if your user's dad's favorite food happens to be window.location = 'http://trojan.notthecondoms.com'.</p>

                        <p>The Function constructor is another form of eval, this should be avoided.  setTimeout and setInterval can be passed a string or a function, when passed a string they are another form of eval, this should also be avoided (plus it's stupid and I can't ever think of a useful scenario for it).</p>
